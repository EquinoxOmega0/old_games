Manual to Amoeba
================



Introduction
------------

This game is a remake of an "ancien" Amiga-game which had the same name. But there are many differences and 
improvements between the old Amiga version and the EquinoxOmega version. In the old one the enemies where flying
over your tank, but they were like amoebas. Not only the design hat changed during the 15 years, there are 
differences in the playmodi and the plot. The Amiga version had only one level and the new one three. In the 
EquinoxOmega your have to destroy the mothership to avoid the invasion(this is the only part where you can see the 
"old" amoebas) but in the old you have got not much time to destroy all enemies. Other advantages of the
EquinoxOmega version are: more different weapons(3 for the player and 5 for the enemies), powerlimit for all 
systems, Jumper, no black background and many more. The only con of the new Version is that there are no coverings 
any more like in the Amiga one, but this happens on purpose.

Player weapons
--------------


Laser : The Laser is your primary weapon. By pressing the W you fire two Laserbeams straight up. This weapons is 
very quick and has a short reload-time. The damgage which does your Laser to the enemies is not very high, but it
is the most efficent weapon against small enemies. If a Laserbeam hits an enemie it will be absorbed.

missel: The missel is no so quick like the Laser but it is much more stronger. After you pressed the Q your missel 
accelerates to its maximum speed. If the missel hits an enemie it will explod, but by doing this it sets a high 
damage to its target. The missel has a medium reload-time and needs more energie than a Laser.

Plasma: The plasma gun is the heaviest weapon of your tank. It needs the most energie, has the longest reload-
time and moves very slow. After you had pressed the E on your keyboard you fired the most dangerous weapon you own.
The main pro of this Plasma gun is that plasma won't be absorbed by the enemies and so it goes straight through 
them by setting a damage continueously.


Enemy weapons
-------------

Laser(L) : The Laser of the enemies is similar to your one but it has a different colour.

bomb(B): The bomb is a often used and very effiective weapon of your enemies. The blast damgages not only the
shields, it sets a small damge to your armour.

superbomb(S) : This is a weapon for multiple damage. It decreases your weapon-, engine- and shieldenergie and 
damges your armour to.

neutralizer(N) : This weapons targets your tank and if it hits it will set a small damage to your shields but your 
engine- and weaponanergie will be much more lower than before the hit.

targeting bomb(T) : This heavy bomb has small engines which continueously correct the position of the falling bomb.
It is a very strong weapon and two of them can destroy your by setting damge to your armour and shields.

Engines
-------

Your tank has two engines. The two boosters and the Jumper. With the booster you can accelerate in both directions
(left and right) until you reach your maximum speed. These engines don't need much energy. The Jumper needs a lot 
of energy to warp the space and allow your tank to travell through subspace to an other place of the gamefield.


Energy
------

Your tank uses three differnt kinds of energies. The first one is the weaponenergy. Every fire needs a bit of this
energy. It reloads itselfs but without energie you can't fire. The loading indicator shows you in how far your 
weapons are ready to fire if there is enough energy. The tiny blue lines at the indicator show the needed energy 
for each weapon. The engine energy is needed for the boosters and the Jumper. Without this energy you can't move or
engage the Jumper. As the weaponenergy it reloades itselfs. The next type of energie is the shieldenergy. If an 
enemy weapon hits you your shieldenergy will be decreaseds. Whitout your shields the enemy fire could damage your
armour and destroy you. The shields are reloadings theirselves but if the are at zero it will take its time to 
restart the reloading sequence.


Rules and aims
--------------

Your primary mission is to destroy all attacking enemies and to save this planet. If the mothership is abel to land
you have lost. You will go game over too, if you are destroyed. Every hit damages your shields and your armour. 
Without any armour you are destroyed. You are allowed to use every weapon against the enemie. Your secondary aim is
to collect as many points as possible. Every destroyed enemy increases your score. You should keep as much as 
possible of your armour too, because these are points too. There are three levels and playing the game will take 
30 or 45 minutes.
