<h1>Introduction</h1><br>
<br>
This game is a remake of an old Amiga100-game with the same name. This game was in monochrom and had no sounds.<br>
<br>




To play Astroids you need 4MB harddisk, Windows 95 or higher and at least a Pentium with 100MHz. You should use your boxes to enjoy the sound!
