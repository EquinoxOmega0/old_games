Your aim is to destroy all astroids. By firing your weapon you can do this. If you hit an astroid, it will split up into two smaller ones. The smallest astroids will be destroyed after hitting them. If an astroid collade with you, your ship will be destroyed. Your gunshots can also destroy you. But you have 5 lives to complete your mission.
