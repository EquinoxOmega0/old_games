Rules
-----

The Master(in this case the Computer) chose four different colors from 8 avaylabels. He
saves this colors in his mind. Your exercise is to guess the colors. But you shouldn't get
only the colors, you should guess the follow of these too. You have 10 tries to do this.
It would be impossible to guess the solution within 10 tries without a help. The Master 
gives it to you. After you guess the colors, the Master gave you a sign. He tells you how 
many colors you guessed and how many of them are at the correct position. With this help
it should be possible to defeat the Master.


Gameplay
--------

Every color has a buttom. If you press it, you'll set one color. You aren't abel to change 
the follow of the colors after you've pushed the buttoms. After you have chosen your 4 
colors you must press the Check-Buttom. Then the help will appear. A black square tells you
that a color is on its correct position and a white one tells you that one color is in the
combination. You've then tries. For every new try you must push the next Try-Buttom. If 
you are unable to get the solution the computer will display it, after you have used every
try. Good Luck!
