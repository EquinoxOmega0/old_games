On the right border of the gaming field there is a small Panel which shows you the state of your ship during the game. This indicator is spilted up into two halfs. The upper one owns Player 1 and the lower one Player 2. Below the text Player 1/2 you can see a picture of your chosen ship. Below that there is a short text, indicates the actuell firemode: "auto" means automatical, "man." manuel and "alt." alternativ. If firemode auto is selected you will fire at your enemy. If he is invisble your are firing straight ahead or backwards. Firemode manuel doesn't target an object. You simply fire ahead(hecktorpedos backwards). Firemode alternativ targets primary at the spezial computerenemy or at spezialweapons of your enemy. If there are none of these objects you fire at the other ship. Lasers are targeting at the objects selected in the firemode. Torpedos are only firing straight ahead or backwards. Spezials don't depend on the firemode. The red line below the firemode indicator shows the strenght of your armout. If there isn't any armout left you will explode. Beside this line there is a yellow one too. It indicates the actuell spezialweaponpower. This power reloades itself. Every use of your spezialweapon lowers this line. Next to this line you will find a row of small circles, which indicate the loading of your torpedos. Red circles are torpedos which are being loaden now, light green circles are bugtorpedos and dark green are hecktorpedos. An other row of circles is beside this. These are the Lasers. Red circles are Lasers which are being loaden and ready lasers are blue circles. Above these circles there is number. This number indicates the score of the player.
