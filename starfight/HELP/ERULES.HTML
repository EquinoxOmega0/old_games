<h1>Rules</h1><br>
<br>
<br>
The playing rules are quiet simple. Who is being destroyed first, has lost. You get one point for every victory. You can play either against an other human or against the computer. Every ship has at its disposal laserweapons, torpedos and spezialweapons. All ships are equally fast but every ship is differently big and can be hit more or less easily. Your armout is decreaded at every collison(but not with an other ship). If your armout is at Zero you'll expolde and you have lost. The sun, the amomalie and the black hole cause a gravitation field and every object is normally influenced by it. There are events which happen with a certain possibility every calculation of the programm. You can only fire if you weapon have enough power. Lots of fun by playing!
