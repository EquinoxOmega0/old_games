How to play
-----------

First chose a ship for Player1 with the left mouse
button and for Player2 with the right one. Then
create or load a mpa for game. If you forget this
the computer will take a standard map. Futhermore
you can make some settings with the menu below the
mapeditor. If you are alone you'll be able to play
against the computer. You start the game by
pressing the big button with the caption 'START
GAME'. The aim is to destroy the other player. You
can either fire differnt weapons on your enemy or
get him into a mapobject. After you has destroyed
the other player, you get back to the main menu.
Your settings will be saved until you quit the 
game. Score is also counted on the right side of
the menu.


Display
-------

Every weapon needs a time to reload. The reloading
of torpedos takes longer than of lasers. The green
points in your display are symbolising loaden 
torpedos. Light green for front luncher and dark
green for the backside one. The loading is
indicated by the red point becoming more and more
redder. Ready loaden Lasers are blue points. 
This beams are able to be fired in all directions.
The red line is your hull structure. It will 
decrease if a weapon hits you or if you are 
getting to close to the sun or an other mapobject.
The yellow line next beside it, shows you your
spezial weapon power. Every use of your spezial 
system lowers your power, but it reloads itself.
The number next to your power indicators is your
score. It shows you how often you've won the 
game. The short text nearby your score is your
current fire mode. "auto" means that you are
targenting automatically to the other player.
"man." stands for manuel. You are only fireing
straight ahead with this mode. With "alt." 
you are looking for alternative targets. You can 
use this mode to intercept enemy spezial weapons
or the third computer enemy. If there is no 
alternative target, you are firing on the other
player.


Map editor
----------

You can create your own maps for game. The map 
editor will help you to do this. For making a new
map you have to click on the button "NEW MAP". 
After this you are able to set the card objects.
Click on the correct button and then on the map 
to put it. After you've put all map objects, you
should save the map by pressing "SAVE GAME". For
using the map for game you must click on the 
button "TAKE THIS MAP FOR GAME". You are also able
to load maps.
